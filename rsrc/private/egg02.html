<p>There really is nothing like a good bowl of cereal in the morning. Some say it is not the most healthy, but I say let the haters hate.</p>
<p>Cereal is good old reliable. A man's breakfast. The original breakfast of champions. It's scientifically proven to be the best way to start the day for growing boys and girls.</p>
<p>A bowl of cereal first thing in the morning fills the muscles with strength and bolsters one's mental fortitude, both of which are necessary to become a champion.</p>
<p>There is one other thing however that many consider to be essential in the morning, and that would be a warm cup of coffee. Second only to a bowl of cereal, coffee is the true energizer.</p>
<p>When paired, the two work in harmony to kick start one's day more effectively than any alternative.</p>
<p>Why don't you go ahead and grab a nice coffee? If not for yourself, then at least for your absolutely caffeine-addicted partner.</p>
<p>Look to him now. Does he seem alright to you? No! He's practically shivering, itching for his morning coffee! He needs it now, there's no time to waste!</p>
<p>It doesn't need to be the most prestigious coffee joint in town, so long as it is close and quick to get to. Now get to it!</p>
<p><small>PS. Maybe grab some things on the way out. You know, the essentials. A book, some snacks perhaps...</small></p>
