<p>That was a really close call. Any longer and the caffeine headache would have started creeping in.</p>
<p>Unfortunately now that we've had our coffee, we've got much <em>too much</em> energy. We'll have to do something about that.</p>
<p>Probably the most sensible thing would be to just go somewhere. Anywhere should be fine, we can work out the destination after we get going.</p>
<p>One thing's for certain though and that is that we'll need wheels. The neighbourhood is fine but who wants to waste Easter day traipsing around the same old haunts as usual.</p>
<p>No, that simply won't do. Today, we follow Gandalf's instructions, the fools we are. Today, we fly!</p>
<p><small>But not actually fly though... Seriously, that was not a hint or anything, that was just goofiness.</small></p>
