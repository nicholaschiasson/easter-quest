<p>Well, it looks like we're almost back where we started. It's been quite the journey, physically <em>and</em> emotionally.</p>
<p>It would seem some gratitude on my part is in order.</p>
<p>Thank you for embarking on this wonderful challenge together with me. I hope you had many laughs and made many new memories from it.</p>
<p>For now, perhaps it's time to go back home and take a little nap. I can't speak for you, but I'm so exhausted I could sink right through the bed and into the floor below.</p>
<p>Just promise me that if that did really happen, you'd rescue me from under there. I've been seeing way too many reels lately of dumb kids folding each other up into retractable couch-beds, and I'm starting to fear our very own murphy bed a bit...</p>
