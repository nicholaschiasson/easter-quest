<p>You've discovered your first Easter egg! How many remain? I suppose we'll just have to find out together.</p>
<p>Each of these eggs will provide you with a hint to find the next one, so be sure to read them carefully.</p>
<p>Get yourself ready for a day of adventure. This quest will have you searching high and low, near and far, inward and outward, squidward and scoutward.</p>
<p>Erm... Ignore that last part.</p>
<p>Get dressed and grab something to eat and drink. You'll need the energy. It never did anybody any good to set out for adventure on an empty stomach!</p>
<p>Might I recommend a bowl of cereal, or perhaps oatmeal?</p>
