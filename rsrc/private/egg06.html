<p>You know, one of my dear old friends' name is Ben. He wasn't really all that big, but he had a big heart at least.</p>
<p>I sure do miss him.</p>
<p>It's easy to take our friendships for granted, you see. One minute, you're growing up with a big circle and all the support you could ask for, close at hand.</p>
<p>The next minute, everyone's gone away getting married, starting families, and just living lives. Darn it, I'm starting to get teary eyed.</p>
<p>Forget this scavenger hunt. I need a drink.</p>
