<p>Hey, what do you know? Turns out that fetching a bike killed two birds with one stone. Congratulations! Although, we don't condone killing birds around here... If anything, we prefer to love and <em>feed</em> them.</p>
<p>I hope by now you've decided on a destination... No? You haven't? Well luckily for you, I happened to use the walking time to think of one for you. Just in case you didn't. As a backup plan.</p>
<p>I thought perhaps a park picnic could be nice. It doesn't have to be in the biggest or nicest park. Perhaps one nearly large enough for a game of hide and seek, but not quite.</p>
<p>The name's escaping me for the moment, but I know you'll know what I mean, and I know you'll find the perfect spot to <em>feed</em>.</p>
