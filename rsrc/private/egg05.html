<p>Well that sure was a lot of fun, but oh boy, look at the <em>time</em>! It's starting to get rather late and there are still eggs to collect!</p>
<p>There's so much to do and not enough <em>time</em>. At least we had a good <em>time</em>. I'm just trying to make sure we get home in <em>time</em> for the TV room (which has been reserved, by the way).</p>
<p>Planning and designing this scavenger hunt has been a real challenge I'll tell you. It's been especially a challenge to strike the right balance of difficulty and <em>bridge</em> the gap between creative and cheesy.</p>
<p>Not to mention, I almost didn't deliver on <em>time</em>.</p>
